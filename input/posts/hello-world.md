Hey there everyone, I'm Andy and here is where I'll be writing about all the cool new things I've been learning about. The plan at the moment is to write about topics including .NET Core, Xamarin, and DevOps.

The first post which will be following this one will be about what I've built the blog in (Wyam), where I'm hosting it (Azure), and the tools I'm using to get it there (VSTS).

Stay tuned!
